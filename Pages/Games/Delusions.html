                    <h1> Introduction</h1>
                    <p class="contact"> <br>Delusions and Delicacies is a game project apart of our project studies in Xamk. We form teams of 2–4 and work together
                        on a larger project to improve our communication and work skills. Once the project is complete or we have worked on it for 135 hours
                        we write a report and submit it for grading. It gets checked and we receive a corresponding amount of credits. <br>
                    </p>

                    <h3>The objectives of the project:</h3>
                    <ol> 
                        <li> Familiarize ourselves with working together<br> on a larger project </li>
                        <li> Make a game we are satisfied with </li>
                        <li> Improve our game developer skills </li>
                        <li> Complete the project for school credits </li>

                    <h4>The Start</h2>
                    <p class="contact maxTextWidth">
                         Once our team was made we started brainstorming ideas and we ended up choosing to make an FPS Arena shooter. All
                        of us were familiar with shooters so we wanted to make one ourselves. We started by filling out a GDD to get a 
                        rough idea of our project. <br></p>
                        <ul> 
                            <li> We will use Unity and Blender </li>
                            <li> Made primarily for PC </li>
                            <li> Stylized low poly art</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="contact maxTextWidth padding">
                    We also discussed our roles in the project which can be seen in The Creators part. I chose to be our 'artist', 
                    because I just started learning blender wanted to focus on modelling.

                        <p class="padding"> These 25 hours were spent researching, designing, modelling and texturing the games very first map. 
                            I tried many different software for the map design and in the end chose Unitys ProBuilder. The base model of each arena is made with 
                            ProBuilder and all detailed props and small objects will be made with Blender. The textures for the environment and the HDRI 
                            are from <a href="https://www.polyhaven.com/">Poly Haven</a>.

                            The map is designed to be made of 4 sections. Each section has its own 'idea' and layout. The sections are:
                            Starting Room, Sewer, Castle and Cathedral. Each section has its own unique objects, colour based on theme, obstacles and danger level.
                            The layout is symmetrical and offers a varying degree of challenge.

                    <h4> Challenges </h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li> 
                                <p class="bold underline">Learning ProBuilder and improving my Blender skills</p>
                                <p>
                                I learned ProBuilder through tutorials and the documentation I practised by creating blockouts of the arenas.
                                Blender problems arose  when exporting to Unity. The textures are blurry and the model would be misaligned because of the difference 
                                of the coordinate systems. Blender uses Z-up while Unity uses Y-up. I solved this by rotating the model 90 degrees on the X-axis when exporting.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="padding"> 
                                <p class="bold underline">Fixing mesh tears and improving arenas</p>
                                <p>
                                While using ProBuilder I made alot of mistakes when creating the arenas. So in a worst case scenario I would have alot of 
                                unnecessary faces and vertices on top of each other and some wrong facing normals on meshes. This would cause z-fighting issues 
                                so I had to go back and redo the arenas.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="padding"> 
                                <p class="bold underline">Bringing my ideas into the game </p>
                                <p> 
                                    As I make the maps I have to figure out how to bring forth the idea of Delusions and Delicasies in a way that fits the game's 
                                    mechanics and style. I was mostly hindered by my inexperience in creating game levels and environments and not knowing the
                                    capabilities of the tools I was using.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li class="padding"> 
                                <p class="bold underline">Creating a good looking and lively environment</p>
                                <p> 
                                    Finding textures that my vision online was hard. After that getting the tiling to fit the environments scale and polish edgecases was
                                    alot of work. I also added lighting and post-processing effects to make the environment look good was also a challenge.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="padding bold">
                            I managed to overcome these challenges by learning new skills and improving my existing ones. And next time I will design and 
                            plan properly to save time and effort.

                        The arenas are coloured based on RGB and the colours represent the difficulty of the environment. 
                        Green easy/introductory, Blue medium, Red hard. The arenas are missing props, details, textures, functionality and barriers 
                        to restrict the players movement as they are still in development.
